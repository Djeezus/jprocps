jprocps
=======

Collection of Java procps-like utilities (such as top, ps, etc)

jtop is the only tool currently implemented, providing a top-like interface for
visualizing CPU usage of Java threads.  This is intended to give you a clue
what to look for when troubleshooting very large or complex multi-threaded Java
applications using jconsole or a traditional debugger.  Looking at you,
IntelliJ.
